== Product Management User Interface Plugin

The +crm-product-ui+ plugin is a companion plugin to the +crm-product+ plugin.
It provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing products.

=== Search products

To query for products you visit +crmProduct/index+ which will show the query form.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the +Search+ button to search for products matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all products will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one product, a product list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one product, then details for that product will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the +list+ view and go directly to the +show+ view.
